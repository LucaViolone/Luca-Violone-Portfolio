Each project includes a written description of its function. The Make.com files are in JSON format so they can be imported into Make.com and edited. Pictures are used as a visual aid along with the JSON to describe the Make.com projects.

Some projects were completed for clients and therefore do not contain every single detail, instead an overview of the purpose and the general layout of the project are described.
