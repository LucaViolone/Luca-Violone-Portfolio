# AIDA-Systems
Software Project Portfolio for AIDA Digital

There are multiple projects in this repository including:
-  An automated agent recruitment system for a real estate agency
-  Prompt based email scraper
-  Prompt based content generation (based on top youtube videos in the prompted category)
-  Content distribution automation
-  Automated viral content recreation and distribution system
-  Photography customer sales pipeline

Each project includes a written description of its function. The Make.com files are in JSON format so they can be imported into Make.com and edited. Pictures are used as a visual aid along with the JSON to describe the Make.com projects.

Some projects were completed for clients and therefore do not contain every single detail, instead an overview of the purpose and the general layout of the project are described.
