**How it works**:
This system utilizes Airtable as a database to store and manipulate data to create a blog post based on the most popular youtube videos in the user generated search area. Using webhooks in Make.com and Airtable the transcripts of the first 5 videos that appear when a prompt is searched on youtube are scraped and stored for ChatGPT to convert into a blog post. A blog is the most desirable output because it can easily be distributed into other short form written posts on platforms such as instagram, LinkedIn, and X using another flow.

**Purpose**:
This system is very valuable to businesses as it would normally require a lot of human labor to complete this task that can have great benefits as content creation is a necessity for businesses and brand awareness. The simple nature of it reduces the friction that previously stopped some small business owners from creating content.
