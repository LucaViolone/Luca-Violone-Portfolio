How it works:
RSS feed scrapes job sites (LinkedIn, Indeed, etc.) --> ChatGPT extracts contact information --> data added to CRM --> Google cloud vision analyzes job profile --> agent specific profile data intelligently included into outreach template by ChatGPT --> Email is sent (or drafted during testing phase) --> CRM outreach status updated --> if no response: follow up is sent 8 days after --> if response: reply with calendar link and create task for employee to reach out and handle meeting

Purpose:
This was built for a real estate agency who was looking to increase the number of agents they had so they could service a larger market. The agency did not have a large recruitment personel so they needed to leverage software to automate laborius human work. I was able to solve their problem and automate their recruitment process while increasing the effectiveness of their recruitment with an outreach campaign that was customized for each agent who recieved a message based on their profile data to increase conversions.
