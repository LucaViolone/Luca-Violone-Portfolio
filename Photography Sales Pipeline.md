**How it works**:
When a client books a reservation through the photographer's website they are automatically added to the Clickup CRM, a confirmation and booking reminder is sent, and an invoice is sent to the client.

**Purpose**:
This is a system that automates a key aspect of the photography business that takes a lot of time away from actually photographing. This allows a photographer to stay organized and automatically capitalize on client opportunities.
