**How it works**:
This flow uses an RSS to scrape the most popular post from any specified subreddit - also note that this concept can be applied to X as well - and from this scraped post a video is created through a few clever steps. A voiceover is generated using Eleven Labs --> stock footage is randomly selected from a spreadsheet full of various video files --> timed captions are created using google text transcription --> Cloudinary is used to combine these seperate files into a video --> ChatGPT generates video descriptions so it can be posted to youtube shorts --> Video is posted (as a draft).

**Purpose**:
I created this system because I was creating content mirroring viral trends and formats, and I realized that the process was formulaic so I attempted to replicate it and solve my problem (which usually results in a good product as well).
