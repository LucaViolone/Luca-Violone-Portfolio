**How it works**:
This flow works by taking user input (blue segments in second image represent user inputted variables) and inputting them into the url of the API request on a RapidAPI endpoint that contains data on the contact information of many  businesses across industries in the US. This data is then processed, stored in a spreadsheet database of AIDA contacts, and used to create a draft to send to the contact based on a template.

**Purpose**:
The purpose of this system is for me to be able to contact businesses in specific niches and also have them all automatically added to my database. Key lead generation system.
